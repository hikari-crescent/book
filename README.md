The Crescent book aims to be a beginner guide for `hikari` and `hikari-crescent`.
Contributions are welcome. If you want a new section I suggest you make an issue first
so you don't write the whole thing then I deny it.

One of the goals of the Crescent book is to provide exercises at the end of each chapter.
I think this will make it better than other guides.

### Sections I want

- [ ] Sales pitch
- [x] basics
- [x] advanced commands (such as groups, message commands, user commands)
- [x] advanced (plugins and hooks)
- [ ] autocomplete
- [ ] events
- [ ] error handling
- [x] ext
    - [x] tasks
    - [x] rate limits
- [ ] Real bot (likely one section)
- [ ] Foreign ext libs

### Hikari things that are not related to crescent
- [ ] Component support with miru
- [ ] Component support with flare
- [ ] Voice Support

### Extending/Hacking crescent
